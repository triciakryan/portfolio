                    <p>This microlearning includes farmers' stories about their motivation to transition to organic
                        certification. It also presents some of the barriers to organic transition and how to reduce
                        them. This microlearning helps you to understand how to follow the USDA organic standards as the
                        basis for a successful transition to certified organic crops, livestock, wild crops, and
                        handling. Tricia Ryan built this microlearning from start to finish; from needs analysis, to
